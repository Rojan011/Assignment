So i built authentication system with a feature as per the guidelines
For database I used Mysql which I hosted locally using XAMPP

->Configuration Steps(for XAMPP):
1.Instal XAMPP by visiting their website
2.Open XAMPP control panel and then we need to start mysql server
3.We need to then go to 127.0.0.1 in browser and access database from there(phpMyAdmin)
4.We can then handle the conenction as shown in the index.js file of the server
